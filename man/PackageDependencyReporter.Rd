\usage{
PackageDependencyReporter
}
\description{
This Reporter takes a package and uncovers the structure from
             its other package dependencies, determining which package it relies on is most central,
             allowing for a developer to determine how to vet its dependency tree
}
\section{Public Methods}{

\describe{
    \item{\code{extract_network(which = "Imports", installed = TRUE, ignorePackages = NULL)}}{
        \itemize{
            \item{This function maps a package's reverse dependency
                  network, allowing for analysis of a package's imports}
            \item{\bold{Args:}}{
                \itemize{
                \item{\bold{\code{depTypes}}: a character vector passed on to \code{which} argument of
                    \link[tools]{package_dependencies} indicating what to count
                    as a package dependency. Default is "Imports".}
                \item{\bold{\code{installed}}: a boolean whether to consider installed
                    packages or CRAN packages. default is TRUE. FALSE is useful if you 
                    would like to vet a package before adding it as a dependency}
                \item{\bold{\code{ignorePackages}}: a vector of package names to ignore 
                    in dependency analysis. They will show up if a package depends on them
                    but their dependencies will be ignored. Useful if you know certain packages
                    are required and have and have a large number of dependencies that clutter
                    the analysis.}

        \item{\bold{Returns: a list with}}{
            \itemize{
                \item{\bold{\code{edges}}: A data.table of directed edges from SOURCE package to TARGET package}
                \item{\bold{\code{nodes}}: A data.table of nodes, where each node is a package}
